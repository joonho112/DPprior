\usage{
verify_score_expectation(a, b, M = .QUAD_NODES_VERIFICATION, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Numeric; shape parameter.}

\item{b}{Numeric; rate parameter.}

\item{M}{Integer; number of quadrature nodes.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if TRUE, print results.}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
\describe{
\item{\code{E_score_a}}{Expectation of \eqn{s_a}}
\item{\code{E_score_b}}{Expectation of \eqn{s_b}}
}
}
\description{
Verifies the fundamental property that \eqn{E[s_\theta(\alpha)] = 0}
for both score functions.
}
\details{
This is a fundamental property of score functions. Due to quadrature
approximation error, the computed expectations may not be exactly zero.

\strong{Expected behavior:}
\itemize{
\item \code{E[s_b]} should be very close to zero (typically < 1e-14)
because s_b is linear in alpha.
\item \code{E[s_a]} may show larger errors (up to 1e-2 for small a)
due to the log(alpha) term causing slower quadrature convergence.
}

For rigorous verification, use adaptive integration (e.g., in Python with
scipy.integrate.quad) which provides independent ground truth.
