Description: Tools for eliciting Gamma hyperpriors on the concentration
    parameter alpha in Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture models. Rather than
    requiring specification of the abstract parameter alpha directly,
    'DPprior' allows researchers to express prior beliefs through intuitive
    quantities: expected cluster counts and weight concentration. The package
    implements Two-Stage Moment Matching (TSMM) with closed-form
    approximations (A1) and exact Newton-based moment matching (A2),
    enabling principled prior specification in low-information settings such
    as multisite trials and meta-analyses. Features include dual-anchor
    elicitation for joint control of cluster counts and weight behavior,
    comprehensive diagnostics, and visualization tools. Based on methods
    described in Lee (2026) <arXiv:2602.06301> and Lee, Che, Rabe-Hesketh,
    Feller, and Miratrix (2025) <doi:10.3102/10769986241254286>.
