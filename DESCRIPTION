Description: Tools for eliciting Gamma hyperpriors on the concentration 
    parameter alpha in Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture models. Rather than 
    requiring specification of the abstract parameter alpha directly, 
    'DPprior' allows researchers to express prior beliefs through intuitive 
    quantities: expected cluster counts and weight concentration. The package 
    implements the DORO 2.0 methodology with closed-form approximations (A1) 
    and exact Newton-based moment matching (A2), enabling principled prior 
    specification in low-information settings such as multisite trials and 
    meta-analyses. Features include dual-anchor elicitation for joint control 
    of cluster counts and weight behavior, comprehensive diagnostics, and 
    visualization tools. Based on methods described in Lee et al. (2025)
